# CoinCapLakeðŸª™
## CoinCap API ingestion

The project focuses on extracting data from CoinCap's public API, transforming the data, and storing it in a data lake and a Postgres database.

The project is powered by Docker, which is required to run it. And to check the updates made to the database, it is recommended to use PgAdmin.

If you have any questions about the API, the official documentation is at https://docs.coincap.io/
